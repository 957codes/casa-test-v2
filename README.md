# Capx Casa

The open control plane for building a company from your terminal.

AI made a single developer as productive as a whole team. Capx Casa does the same
for the founder. A solo founder is excellent at one thing, but a company is a hundred
things at once. Casa holds the hundred: it figures out which of them matter for
your specific business, puts them in the right order, runs what it can, and tells
you what to do next, every time you open the terminal.

Casa is an open-source (MIT) Claude Code plugin. It runs inside your own Claude
Code, on your own plan. No SaaS login, no hosted inference, nothing to deploy. The
terminal is the source of truth. An optional local Console gives you a visual,
interactive control surface on localhost when you want one, running on the same
machine, against the same files, with no account and no cloud.

## What it gives you

- A library of company-building playbooks (the "what to do").
- A router that selects the playbooks relevant to your business and sequences
  them into a personalized build map (the "what to do when").
- An always-on advisor that recommends your single next best action on every
  session.
- Recurring loops for the work that never finishes (metrics, customers, growth).
- A company brain: durable, versioned, plain-text memory that makes every run
  compound on the last.
- An optional local Console: a visual, interactive view of the whole build map,
  the company's health, and its loops, that can also start work for you.

## The Console (optional, local, interactive)

The Console is a visual control surface for the company, served on localhost from
the same company brain the terminal reads. It is optional and everything in Casa
works without it. Launch it with `/casa-console`.

What you can do in it:

- See the whole company at a glance. The build map renders as a node graph, grouped
  by level, colored by one of five states (done, agent can do it, needs your input,
  needs your approval, blocked by earlier work), with the items awaiting you flagged.
- Open any node for its detail. Each node shows a plain-language TLDR and advisor
  notes, the gradeable deliverable spec (what a good output contains), a quality
  score for finished work with its gaps, the rendered output, recent activity, and a
  chat to refine it.
- Start work, not just watch it. Buttons run a ready play, mark it complete, approve
  or request changes on a gate, or re-score and improve finished work. A per-node
  chat lets you ask for a change in words.
- Watch the company's health. A single health score breaks into the dimensions that
  move it (do-or-die coverage, momentum, quality of finished work, open gates, loop
  hygiene), with per-department roll-ups and a "make done work better" list of work
  that is ungraded or below the bar.
- Track loops and spend. The Loops view shows every recurring cadence with its due
  or locked status; the Health view shows spend to date through Capx Pay, labeled
  distinctly and never charged by the Console.

How it stays safe and subscription-only:

- Deterministic actions (mark complete, mark a loop ran) run the engine inline. The
  engine remains the only writer of company state, so a click can never skip a gate
  or invent a dependency.
- Anything that needs an LLM (run a play, refine by chat, re-score) is queued, not
  executed. You drain that queue yourself with `/casa-serve` in your own Claude Code
  session. The Console never spawns an agent and never runs headless.
- The Console binds to localhost only, adds no dependencies to the plugin runtime,
  and reads the same plain-text brain you can read in the terminal.

## The level model

Casa organizes the work into levels. You move through them in order, gated by
measurable criteria. The router personalizes which playbooks fire inside each
level for your business type.

| Level | Name | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| Always-on | Foundations | Safety gates and cost governance |
| Level 0 | Ideation and Validation | Find a validated opportunity worth building |
| Level 1 | Commit and Incorporate | Pick the wedge, form the entity, secure the brand |
| Level 2 | Product and Infra Foundation | Stand up hosting, security, analytics, pricing |
| Level 3 | Build and Pre-launch | Build the product, prep launch, start channels |
| Level 4 | Launch | Coordinated launch burst |
| Level 5 | First Customers and PMF | Iterate to retention, establish customer success |
| Level 6 | Scale Acquisition | Compound via paid, organic, partnerships |
| Level 7 | Enterprise Sales (conditional) | Upmarket motion for high-ACV B2B |
| Level 8 | Growth Finance and Fundraise | Institutionalize finance, raise capital |

## Commands

## Getting started

1. Make a new, empty project folder for your company and open it in Claude Code.
2. Install the plugin:

   ```
   /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/957codes/casa-test-v1
   /plugin install capx-casa
   ```

3. Set up your company. Casa works for a brand-new idea or a business already
   running:

   ```
   /casa-start
   ```

   It asks a short series of questions to learn what the business is and where it is
   today, then builds a personalized map that starts at the right level. A raw idea
   gets validated first; an existing business skips ahead, with anything you have not
   done yet surfaced as catch-up work.

4. Every time you reopen the project, Casa greets you with your level, progress, and
   top priority. Run `/casa-priority` to re-evaluate, or `/casa-next` to act.

See `docs/ONBOARDING.md` for the full walkthrough.

## Updating Casa

When a new version is pushed, refresh the marketplace, update the plugin, and reload
it into your current session:

```
/plugin marketplace update capx-casa
/plugin update capx-casa@capx-casa
/reload-plugins
```

`/reload-plugins` activates the new skills and commands without restarting Claude Code.
Notes:

- The marketplace and the plugin are both named `capx-casa`. If `/plugin marketplace list`
  shows it under a different alias, use that name in steps 1 and 2.
- Casa is versioned by git commit, so every push counts as an update. If `/plugin update`
  reports "already up to date" when you know there are new commits, run the marketplace
  update first (it re-fetches the repo).
- The visual Console rebuilds itself on first use after an update: the next `/casa-console`
  runs `npm install && npm run build` once (about a minute) and serves the new UI.

## How it works

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the design, `docs/BUILD-PLAN.md` for the full
plan, `console/README.md` for the Console (how to build, run, and the two-way model
behind it), and `CLAUDE.md` for the operating contract this repo runs under.

## License

MIT. The skills, agents, loops, and router are free forever. Real-world actions
that cost money (domains, incorporation, hosting, generative media, research) run
through the companion product Capx Pay, which holds the wallet and the billing.
Casa never charges or holds funds. You can always bring your own keys and pay
nothing.
